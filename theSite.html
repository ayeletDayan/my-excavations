                <h1>The Site</h1>
            <p class="site-info">The site is located on a low hill where remains of an extensive settlement in which
                kurkar (sandstone)
                building stones were found, along with the remains of installations and sherds dating from the Roman to
                the Ottoman periods. At Horbat Meshullam, c. 1.5 km southwest of the excavation area, remains were
                excavated in the past of an installation dating to the Roman-Byzantine period. In a survey that preceded
                the excavation at Gan Ha-Darom, remains of architecture: kurkar stones, some dressed, were found
                protruding on the surface, perhaps the remains of a structure, as well as numerous sherds, dated mostly
                to the Byzantine period. These included fragments of a tabun, jars, kraters, a casserole and a few
                sherds, dating from the late Roman-early Byzantine periods.</p>
